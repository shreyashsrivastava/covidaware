                            Cover mouth and nose with mask and make sure there are no gaps between your face and the mask.
                            Avoid touching the mask while using it; if you do, clean your hands with alcohol-based hand 
                            rub or soap and water.
                            Replace the mask with a new one as soon as it is damp and do not re-use single-use masks.
                            To remove the mask: remove it from behind (do not touch the front of mask); 
                            discard immediately

                        <p>Social distancing involves avoiding large gatherings.
                           If you have to be around people, keep 6 feet (2 meters) between you when possible. 
                           “Social distancing is pretty much like using common sense,” Dr. Gordon says. 
                           “We don’t realize how interconnected we are until we’re asked to avoid people.” 
                           But he notes that terms like “mass gatherings” or “congregate settings” are vague. 
                           They’re used to describe things like shopping centers, movie theaters or stadiums. 
                           But how many people together is too many? “That’s a moving target,” he says. 
                           There’s no official definition, though the CDC recently advised that all U.S. 
                           events of 10+ people should be cancelled or held virtually.

                        <p>Using clean, running water is important. Never wash your hands by submerging them in a basin or bowl of standing water. This water could contain germs that continue to live there. Sometimes, clean running water is affected by natural disasters (tornados, hurricanes, etc.). There is still some benefit to washing your hands with soap in these situation as long as it is running water.
                            Avoid touching doorknobs, toilet flush handles, and faucets after washing your hands. Try using a paper towel, the sleeve of your clothing, a scarf, or gloves to protect your hands and fingers against germs.
                            Do not leave hand sanitizer unattended around small children. Drinking it is poisonous.

                        <p>Remote work has been on the rise for years in many companies. Some offer remote work as a benefit to employees for better work-life balance.
                            And today, millions of people around the world have recently started working from home (WFH) because of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.
                            WFH is great for work-life balance. It increases ownership and performance. It trains people to be focused and disciplined. I look forward to seeing the productive benefits of trust and empowerment.
                            Everyone’s situation is different in terms of home environment, personality and habits. My advice is to ignore any tips that clash with your personal beliefs. Tailor the most effective way of working for you and keep practicing until it becomes part of a lifestyle or culture.
